# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Ensure your vulnerability is on the latest version, as I will only respond to ones on the latest version, you can find what version you are on the footer on the home page.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. To report a vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:  

### High-Severity Vulnerabilities

- Email me directly at **[dominikwajda@hotmail.com](mailto:dominikwajda@hotmail.com)** with the subject line: `Security Vulnerability Report - Liberatube`.  
- Include a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any potential impact.  
- If possible, include proof-of-concept (PoC) code.  
- **Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability** until weâ€™ve had an opportunity to assess and address the issue.  
- We strive to respond to high-severity reports within **48 hours** and provide updates on the resolution process.  

### Low-Severity Vulnerabilities

- Open an issue on the [GitHub Issues section](https://github.com/golddominik893/liberatube/issues).  
- Clearly label the issue with `[Low-Severity]` and provide relevant details to help us investigate.  

## Scope of Vulnerability Reporting

I am particularly interested in vulnerabilities related to:  

- Authentication and authorization mechanisms.  
- Code injection (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, etc.).  
- Security misconfigurations.  
- Sensitive data exposure.  
- Dependencies with known vulnerabilities.  

Issues outside this scope may be addressed at our discretion.
